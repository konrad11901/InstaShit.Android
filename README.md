# InstaShit.Android

[![Build status](https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/c53dfdf9-50aa-4f7b-b9d8-ba381c9afd63/branches/master/badge)](https://appcenter.ms)

InstaShit for Android operating system.

**Support for InstaShit.Android has ended.** No new updates (including InstaShitCore updates and bug fixes) will be provided. InstaShit.Android is buggy and is not fully compatible with Android 8.0+. It's strongly recommended to switch to InstaShit.CLI or InstaShit.Bot.  
**Please note that since November 2018 this application doesn't work due to changes introduced to Insta.Ling.** If you really need InstaShit.Android, you can compile it yourself with the newest InstaShitCore, but it's not recommended.

*Note: The support may be restored if I rewrite this app in the future, but as for now, it's not planned.*
